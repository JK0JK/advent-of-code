# Hey! You shouldn't be here!
This is my repository for the annnual (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/]!
If you're here, you're either analysing my old answers (sorry if my code stinks) or trying to see what the answers are for today!

Either that or you're a potential employer looking into my code to see what I code like. In that case, <i> please ignore the "sorry if my code stinks" remark, it's a joke and my code is actually great, flawless and has absolutely no bugs! Please take my word for it and do not check the code for any flaws!</i>

# DO NOT CHEAT ON THE CHALLENGE
The Advent of Code is a challenge! You're not in it for the win, you're in it for the fun. And for having an excuse to code when you want to but don't know what to!

That said, I will `git commit && git push` the changes as soon as I'm done with the challenge for the day. In that sense, you <i>can</i> use my code to cheat, but if you do then please go outside and touch grass with the time you saved. No one is impressed, but hopefully that saved you time for introspection.
